# FAAST Advance Foundations Assignments

## Introduction

This assignment uses life expectancy in Europe grouped by Country (or other, like group of countries), Age, Sex, and Time. But the data format makes it hard to use. The task consists into cleaning the data and applying the concepts you've learned in the previous modules.

## Installing

Before installing, make sure your `pip` is up to date.

```bash
pip --version
```

Prior to the introduction of `pyproject.toml`-based builds (in PEP 517 and PEP 518), pip had only supported installing packages using setup.py files that were built using `setuptools`. But in version 21.3, pip added support for performing editable installs of packages that use `pyproject.toml`. This means that you can use pip to install packages described in the `pyproject.toml`.

To update pip, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Now you're ready to go!

1. Clone this repo to your personal GitHub account.
2. Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`. If you are using conda, you can create a virtual environment with `conda create --name foundations`.
3. Activate the virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows. Or, if you are on conda, activate the environment with `conda activate foundations`.
4. Install its dependencies on editable mode with `pip install -e '.[dev]'`.

## Using this project

Open the `README.md` file inside each assignment and follow the instructions.
